# Deeplearning_io
This repository includes my solutions for Andrew Ng's [Deeplearning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) programming exercises.
You can see the projects by clicking the hyperlinks below.

**Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning**
- [Python Basics with Numpy](https://github.com/XuShaoming/Deeplearning_io/blob/master/Neural_Networks_and_Deep_Learning/Python%2BBasics%2BWith%2BNumpy%2Bv3.ipynb) :
